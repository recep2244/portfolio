Signal of the day
Cytotoxicity, apoptosis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics study of novel compounds of Sulfamide derivatives coupled with DHP scaffolds as potent inhibitors of the MCF-7, A549, SKOV-3, and EA. yh926 carcinoma cells.
A novel series of dihydropyridine-sulfonyl derivatives (AG-CHO and analogues A1-A7) were synthesized and structurally characterized. Molecular docking demonstrated favorable binding of these compounds to autophagy-associated and cancer-related targets, while molecular dynamics simulations confirmed A5 as the most stable ligand protein interactions. Functional assays in SKOV-3, MCF-7, A549, and EA.hy.926 cells using acridine orange staining and flow cytometry revealed significant autophagy induction. Among all tested compounds AG-CHO emerged as the most potent inducer of autophagy. Notably, derivatives such as A6 and A7 showed selective potency in endothelial cells, whereas A1, A5, and A7 were effective in A549 cells, indicating cell-specific activity. Collectively, this integrated computational and experimental study identifies A5 as the lead compound and highlights dihydropyridine-sulfonyl scaffolds as promising autophagy modulators and potential anticancer candidates for further preclinical development.
Why it matters: Enhances small-molecule or peptide docking accuracy for targeted drug discovery.

  Abstract: The discovery and engineering of new enzymes is important across the bioeconomy, with diverse applications from foods to pharmaceuticals, sensors to agriculture. However, enzyme engineering, in particular machine learning-guided engineering, is hampered by a lack of data. Currently there exists no database designed to capture and interpret datasets created in this domain, nor are there easy analys...

  Abstract: Abstract As a traditional hair-growth-promoting herb, Platycladi Cacumen(PC) has a long history of folk application in the field of hair loss improvement. Preliminary modern pharmacological studies have suggested that its active components may exert potential effects by regulating hair follicle-related signaling pathways; however, for androgenetic alopecia (AGA), the exact targets and specific reg...

  Abstract: Molecular docking is a critical computational strategy in drug discovery, but the diversity of biomolecular structures and flexible binding conformations create an enormous search space that challenges conventional computing. Quantum computing holds promise but remains constrained by scalability, hardware limitations, and precision issues. Here, we report a probabilistic computer (p-computer) prot...
- Structure-Aware Antibody Design with Affinity-Optimized Inverse Folding - arXiv - 2025-12-19 (http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17815v1)
  Abstract: Motivation: The clinical efficacy of antibody therapeutics critically depends on high-affinity target engagement, yet laboratory affinity-maturation campaigns are slow and costly. In computational settings, most protein language models (PLMs) are not trained to favor high-affinity antibodies, and existing preference optimization approaches introduce substantial computational overhead without clear...
