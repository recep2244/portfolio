# Subscription Options for Review

Since you want to share this on LinkedIn/Twitter, appearance matters. Here are the best options:

## Option 1: Tally.so (Recommended for Design)
**Best for:** Social Media links (Twitter/LinkedIn).
- **Pros:** Beautiful, Notion-style design. Free. No coding required.
- **Cons:** You still need to manually copy emails to `subscribers.csv` (unless you set up Zapier).
- **How:** Go to [Tally.so](https://tally.so), create a form, and get the link.

## Option 2: Formspree (Recommended for Personal Site)
**Best for:** Embedding directly into your Personal/Portfolio website.
- **Pros:** Users stay on your website. Looks professional.
- **Cons:** Free tier has limits (50/month).
- **How:** 
  1. Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io) to get a unique URL.
  2. Use the HTML code below in your website.

## Option 3: Google Forms (Reliable)
**Best for:** High volume, zero cost.
- **Pros:** Unlimited responses. Exports to Sheets easily.
- **Cons:** Looks "generic" and less premium.

### Update your Landing Page
I have updated `subscribe.html` to look like a "Link-in-Bio" page. You can add your chosen Form link there.
