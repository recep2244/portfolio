                I am a dedicated Bioinformatician with a unique academic background spanning Physics and Bioengineering.
                Currently serving as a Research Associate at the University of Reading, I focus on the improvement of
                protein tertiary and quaternary structure predictions.

                My work involves developing and refining advanced tools like the IntFOLD server, utilizing Molecular
                Dynamics simulations, and applying Machine Learning techniques to solve complex biological problems. I
                am passionate about bridging the gap between computational physics and molecular biology to unravel the
                mysteries of protein structures.
