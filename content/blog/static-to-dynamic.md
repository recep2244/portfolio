# From Static to Dynamic: The Future of Protein Modelling

The 3D structure of proteins governs their molecular functionality. While methods like AlphaFold2 have revolutionised prediction, they typically generate static models.

## The Limitation of Static Models
Proteins are not rigid statues; they are breathing, moving machines. Static models overlook:
- **Conformational Diversity**: Proteins often exist in ensembles of states.
- **Allostery**: How binding at one site affects another.
- **Mutation Effects**: How a single amino acid change alters flexibility.

## My Vision
My vision is to transform protein structure prediction from static to dynamic. By developing an iterative protocol that generates and evaluates alternative conformations, we can capture the natural dynamics of proteins, including those with mutations or entirely novel sequences.

This dynamic modelling capability is essential for understanding function, flexibility, and interactions in biologically relevant contexts.
