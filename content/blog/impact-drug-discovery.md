# Impact on Drug Discovery & Synthetic Biology

The ability to predict rare conformational states and engineer synthetic biomolecules will have far-reaching impacts on biomedical research.

## Accelerating Therapeutics
The global pharmaceutical market is projected to exceed **$1.7 trillion**, yet drug development remains costly. Dynamic modelling can:
- **Identify Cryptic Pockets**: Reveal binding sites only visible in transient states.
- **Predict Resistance**: Model how mutations affect drug binding.
- **Design Biologics**: Engineer antibodies with specific binding properties.

## Synthetic Biology & Enzymes
Beyond health, this work fuels innovation in sustainable biotechnology. By rationally designing novel enzymes, we can create more efficient biocatalysts for industrial processes.

My work aims to equip the UK research community with transformative tools that enable these new scientific insights, establishing the UK as a global leader in computational protein dynamics.
