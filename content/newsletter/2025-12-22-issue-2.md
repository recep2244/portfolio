### [Cytotoxicity, apoptosis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics study of novel compounds of Sulfamide derivatives coupled with DHP scaffolds as potent inhibitors of the MCF-7, A549, SKOV-3, and EA. yh926 carcinoma cells.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioorg.2025.109393)

#### 🧬 Abstract
A novel series of dihydropyridine-sulfonyl derivatives (AG-CHO and analogues A1-A7) were synthesized and structurally characterized. Molecular docking demonstrated favorable binding of these compounds to autophagy-associated and cancer-related targets, while molecular dynamics simulations confirmed A5 as the most stable ligand protein interactions. Functional assays in SKOV-3, MCF-7, A549, and EA.hy.926 cells using acridine orange staining and flow cytometry revealed significant autophagy induction. Among all tested compounds AG-CHO emerged as the most potent inducer of autophagy. Notably, derivatives such as A6 and A7 showed selective potency in endothelial cells, whereas A1, A5, and A7 were effective in A549 cells, indicating cell-specific activity. Collectively, this integrated computational and experimental study identifies A5 as the lead compound and highlights dihydropyridine-sulfonyl scaffolds as promising autophagy modulators and potential anticancer candidates for further preclinical development.

### [Meeko: Molecule Parametrization and Software Interoperability for Docking and Beyond.](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c02271)
Molecule parametrization is an essential requirement to guarantee the accuracy of docking calculations. Parametrization includes a proper perception of chemical properties such as bonds, formal charges and protonation states. This includes large biological macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, and small molecules, such as ligands and cofactors. The structures of proteins and nucleic acids are challenging due to omission of several atoms from the structural model, and from the lack of connectivity and bond order information in the PDB and mmCIF file formats. For small molecules, the very large chemical diversity poses challenges for both validating correctness and providing accurate parameters. These challenges affect various modeling approaches like molecular docking and molecular dynamics. Moreover, several specialized methods (particularly in molecular docking) leverage specific chemical properties to add custom potentials, pseudoatoms, or manipulate atomic connectivity. To address these challenges, we developed Meeko, a molecular parametrization Python package that leverages the widely used RDKit cheminformatics library for a chemically accurate description of the molecular representation. Small molecules are modeled as single RDKit molecules, and biological macromolecules as multiple RDKit molecules, one for each residue. Meeko is highly customizable and designed to be easily scriptable for high-throughput processing, replacing MGLTools for receptor and ligand preparation.

### [From sweetener to risk factor: Network toxicology, molecular docking and molecular dynamics reveal the mechanism of aspartame in promoting coronary heart disease.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2025.111876)
Aspartame, a widely used non-nutritive sweetener, has been epidemiologically linked to coronary heart disease (CHD), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study employed an integrative computational strategy combining network toxicology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics to decode aspartame's CHD-promoting mechanisms. Initially, the toxicity profile of aspartame was predicted using ProTox 3.0 and ADMETlab 3.0, which highlighted significant cardiotoxicity. Through multi-source target screening of aspartame (PharmMapper, SEA, etc.) and CHD (GeneCards, OMIM), 216 shared targets were identified. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed 10 hub targets (INS, PPARGC1A, TNF, AKT1, IL6, MMP9, IGF1, PTGS2, SIRT1, PPARG). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses revealed significant enrichment in lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis-related pathways. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) demonstrated high-affinity binding of aspartame to three core targets (PTGS2, TNF, and PPARGC1A), with a binding energy ≤ -7.0 kcal/mol, and confirmed high binding stability. This study reveals that aspartame may promote the pathogenesis of CHD by disrupting cardiovascular homeostasis through multi-target interactions, including inflammatory response, metabolic dysregulation, and vascular remodeling. These findings provide molecular evidence for re-evaluating the safety profile of aspartame and establish a computational framework to guide experimental validation and preventive strategies.

### [Enzyme Engineering Database (EnzEngDB): a platform for sharing and interpreting sequence-function relationships across protein engineering campaigns.](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaf1142)
The discovery and engineering of new enzymes is important across the bioeconomy, with diverse applications from foods to pharmaceuticals, sensors to agriculture. However, enzyme engineering, in particular machine learning-guided engineering, is hampered by a lack of data. Currently there exists no database designed to capture and interpret datasets created in this domain, nor are there easy analysis and visualisation tools. We developed the Enzyme Engineering Database to provide a centralized resource and an online analysis tool to consolidate sequence-function data from enzyme engineering campaigns, thereby making three contributions: (i) a database into which researchers can deposit public data, (ii) visualisation and analysis tools for protein engineers to analyse their own data or compare enzyme variants to other engineering campaigns, and (iii) a gold-standard dataset for benchmarking automated extraction along with the first large language model extraction pipeline specific for enzyme engineering campaigns. The Enzyme Engineering Database is accessible at http://enzengdb.org/.
