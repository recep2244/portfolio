## 🏆 Top Signals of the Week

### Sunday: [Electrochemical techniques in protein engineering: Innovations in redox-active protein design and electron transfer mechanisms.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2025.149750)
_Strengthens de novo design by improving sequence or structure search._

Redox-active protein engineering has emerged as a promising field with applications in biosensing, bioelectrocatalysis, synthetic biology, and bioelectronics. Electrochemical techniques such as impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and scanning electrochemical microscopy are central to probing electron transfer mechanisms, tuning redox potentials, and analyzing protein-electrode interactions. This review highlights recent advances in electrochemical approaches that support the design and functional optimization of engineered redox proteins. It discusses how artificial intelligence and computational modelling facilitate the identification of mutations that enhance electron transfer efficiency. Additionally, the review examines how synthetic biology enables the construction of artificial electron transport pathways, and how nanostructured materials such as carbon nanotubes, metal-organic frameworks, and conductive polymers improve protein immobilization and charge conduction. Scalable production methods like recombinant expression and cell-free synthesis have increased the accessibility of these proteins for industrial applications. Their integration into wearable and real-time diagnostic platforms reflects growing utility in healthcare monitoring. However, challenges such as protein stability, precise control of tunneling, and effective electronic integration remain. Addressing these through interdisciplinary strategies will be key to advancing protein-based bioelectronic systems.

## ⚡ Selected Quick Reads

- **[SurfFold: A Unified Model for Protein Inverse Folding by Integrating Surface and Structural Information.](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf666)**: <h4>Motivation</h4>Proteins play a crucial role in biological systems, and accurate protein sequence prediction is essential for applications such as drug discovery. Existing inverse folding models primarily rely on protein backbone structure information, overlooking the biochemical properties embedded in protein surface data that constrain its functionality, leading to limited prediction accuracy.<h4>Result</h4>we propose a novel inverse folding framework, SurfFold, which integrates both protein backbone structure and surface information for sequence prediction. Additionally, it incorporates side-chain structural information and its interaction with surface information. Then we introduces a Representation alignment module to better fuse structure and surface Representations. Experimental results demonstrate that SurfFold achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CATH4.2 dataset, and additional experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules. Moreover the homologous structure inverse folding experiment also demonstrates that SurfFold possesses excellent capability in homologous protein design.<h4>Availability</h4>The source code and data are available at https://github.com/jiudizhengf/SurfFold.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
