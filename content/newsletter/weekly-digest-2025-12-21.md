## 🏆 Top Signals of the Week

### Sunday: [Electrochemical techniques in protein engineering: Innovations in redox-active protein design and electron transfer mechanisms.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2025.149750)
_Expands the searchable sequence space for novel folds and high-affinity binders._

Redox-active protein engineering has emerged as a promising field with applications in biosensing, bioelectrocatalysis, synthetic biology, and bioelectronics. Electrochemical techniques such as impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and scanning electrochemical microscopy are central to probing electron transfer mechanisms, tuning redox potentials, and analyzing protein-electrode interactions. This review highlights recent advances in electrochemical approaches that support the design and functional optimization of engineered redox proteins. It discusses how artificial intelligence and computational modelling facilitate the identification of mutations that enhance electron transfer efficiency. Additionally, the review examines how synthetic biology enables the construction of artificial electron transport pathways, and how nanostructured materials such as carbon nanotubes, metal-organic frameworks, and conductive polymers improve protein immobilization and charge conduction. Scalable production methods like recombinant expression and cell-free synthesis have increased the accessibility of these proteins for industrial applications. Their integration into wearable and real-time diagnostic platforms reflects growing utility in healthcare monitoring. However, challenges such as protein stability, precise control of tunneling, and effective electronic integration remain. Addressing these through interdisciplinary strategies will be key to advancing protein-based bioelectronic systems.

- **[Classifying Metamorphic versus Single-Fold Proteins with Statistical Learning and AlphaFold2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10066v1)**: The remarkable success of AlphaFold2 in providing accurate atomic-level prediction of protein structures from their amino acid sequence has transformed approaches to the protein folding problem. However, its core paradigm of mapping one sequence to one structure may only be appropriate for single-fold proteins with one stable conformation. Metamorphic proteins, which can adopt multiple distinct conformations, have conformational diversity that cannot be adequately modeled by AlphaFold2. Hence, classifying whether a given protein is metamorphic or single-fold remains a critical challenge for both laboratory experiments and computational methods. To address this challenge, we developed a novel classification framework by re-purposing AlphaFold2 to generate conformational ensembles via a multiple sequence alignment sampling method. From these ensembles, we extract a comprehensive set of features characterizing the conformational ensemble's modality and structural dispersion. A random forest classifier trained on a carefully curated benchmark dataset of known metamorphic and single-fold proteins achieves a mean AUC of 0.869 with cross-validation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our integrated approach. Furthermore, by applying our classifier to 600 randomly sampled proteins from the Protein Data Bank, we identified several potential metamorphic protein candidates -- including the 40S ribosomal protein S30, whose conformational change is crucial for its secondary function in antimicrobial defense. By combining AI-driven protein structure prediction with statistical learning, our work provides a powerful new approach for discovering metamorphic proteins and deepens our understanding of their role in their molecular function.
