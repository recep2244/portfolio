### [Electrochemical techniques in protein engineering: Innovations in redox-active protein design and electron transfer mechanisms.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41418956/)
_Strengthens de novo design by improving sequence or structure search._

Redox-active protein engineering has emerged as a promising field with applications in biosensing, bioelectrocatalysis, synthetic biology, and bioelectronics. Electrochemical techniques such as impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and scanning electrochemical microscopy are central to probing electron transfer mechanisms, tuning redox potentials, and analyzing protein-electrode interactions. This review highlights recent advances in electrochemical approaches that support the design and functional optimization of engineered redox proteins. It discusses how artificial intelligence and computational modelling facilitate the identification of mutations that enhance electron transfer efficiency. Additionally, the review examines how synthetic biology enables the construction of artificial electron transport pathways, and how nanostructured materials such as carbon nanotubes, metal-organic frameworks, and conductive polymers improve protein immobilization and charge conduction. Scalable production methods like recombinant expression and cell-free synthesis have increased the accessibility of these proteins for industrial applications. Their integration into wearable and real-time diagnostic platforms reflects growing utility in healthcare monitoring. However, challenges such as protein stability, precise control of tunneling, and effective electronic integration remain. Addressing these through interdisciplinary strategies will be key to advancing protein-based bioelectronic systems.

### [SurfFold: A Unified Model for Protein Inverse Folding by Integrating Surface and Structural Information.](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf666)
<h4>Motivation</h4>Proteins play a crucial role in biological systems, and accurate protein sequence prediction is essential for applications such as drug discovery. Existing inverse folding models primarily rely on protein backbone structure information, overlooking the biochemical properties embedded in protein surface data that constrain its functionality, leading to limited prediction accuracy.<h4>Result</h4>we propose a novel inverse folding framework, SurfFold, which integrates both protein backbone structure and surface information for sequence prediction. Additionally, it incorporates side-chain structural information and its interaction with surface information. Then we introduces a Representation alignment module to better fuse structure and surface Representations. Experimental results demonstrate that SurfFold achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CATH4.2 dataset, and additional experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules. Moreover the homologous structure inverse folding experiment also demonstrates that SurfFold possesses excellent capability in homologous protein design.<h4>Availability</h4>The source code and data are available at https://github.com/jiudizhengf/SurfFold.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

### [Target-specific therapeutic assessment of repurposed drug candidates for oral lichen planus: a network pharmacology-molecular dynamics simulation guided investigation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41419452/)
Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic mucocutaneous autoimmune skin disease without a proper pathophysiology and approved therapy. As a result, several repurposed drugs have been used in clinical practice, and it remains unclear which one holds greater potential. The present study employs a network pharmacology to explore the disease biology and further investigate the target-specific binding efficacy of repurposed drugs. Twenty-eight repurposed drug's (D1-D28) efficacies against twelve targets were investigated using PyRx 0.8-AutoDock 4.2 software. Further, drug stability and reactivity were studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at 200 ns, Gibbs free energy, frontier molecular orbital theory, and structural activity relationship. The above computational investigation suggested betamethasone (D2/BETA) and triamcinolone acetonide (D28/TACA) are two potential drugs, predominantly demonstrating higher binding efficacy against the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Further, MD simulation, free-energy calculation revealed that D28/TACA was comparatively more stable than D2/BETA. The network pharmacology explored possible drug targets for drug discovery and showed that D28/TACA is a more effective treatment option among repurposed drugs.

### [Missense3D-PTMdb: a web tool for visualising and exploring human genetic variants and post-translational modification sites using AlphaFold models.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2025.169595)
Only a fraction of the >11 million missense variants identified in humans has a known clinical significance. Post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, glycosylation and ubiquitination, are key regulators of protein function and structure. PTMs depend on correct protein folding and the recognition and binding of enzymes to specific amino acid motifs near modification sites. AlphaFold models provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore variants on 3D structures, enabling systematic identification of amino acid substitutions that could affect PTMs and should be further investigated experimentally. We present Missense3D-PTMdb, a "one-stop-shop" interactive web tool that provides a user-friendly sequence-structure mapping of 20,235 human proteins, 11,5 million naturally occurring human missense variants, >60 PTM types and 203,775 PTM residues and their neighbours in sequence and 3D structure space using AlphaFold models of the human proteome. The resource also supports visualization of novel variants not in the database. Missense3D-PTMdb is freely available at https://missense3d.bc.ic.ac.uk/ptmdb.
