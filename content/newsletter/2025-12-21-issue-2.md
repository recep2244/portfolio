### [Electrochemical techniques in protein engineering: Innovations in redox-active protein design and electron transfer mechanisms.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2025.149750)
_Expands the searchable sequence space for novel folds and high-affinity binders._

Redox-active protein engineering has emerged as a promising field with applications in biosensing, bioelectrocatalysis, synthetic biology, and bioelectronics. Electrochemical techniques such as impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and scanning electrochemical microscopy are central to probing electron transfer mechanisms, tuning redox potentials, and analyzing protein-electrode interactions. This review highlights recent advances in electrochemical approaches that support the design and functional optimization of engineered redox proteins. It discusses how artificial intelligence and computational modelling facilitate the identification of mutations that enhance electron transfer efficiency. Additionally, the review examines how synthetic biology enables the construction of artificial electron transport pathways, and how nanostructured materials such as carbon nanotubes, metal-organic frameworks, and conductive polymers improve protein immobilization and charge conduction. Scalable production methods like recombinant expression and cell-free synthesis have increased the accessibility of these proteins for industrial applications. Their integration into wearable and real-time diagnostic platforms reflects growing utility in healthcare monitoring. However, challenges such as protein stability, precise control of tunneling, and effective electronic integration remain. Addressing these through interdisciplinary strategies will be key to advancing protein-based bioelectronic systems.

### [Classifying Metamorphic versus Single-Fold Proteins with Statistical Learning and AlphaFold2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10066v1)
The remarkable success of AlphaFold2 in providing accurate atomic-level prediction of protein structures from their amino acid sequence has transformed approaches to the protein folding problem. However, its core paradigm of mapping one sequence to one structure may only be appropriate for single-fold proteins with one stable conformation. Metamorphic proteins, which can adopt multiple distinct conformations, have conformational diversity that cannot be adequately modeled by AlphaFold2. Hence, classifying whether a given protein is metamorphic or single-fold remains a critical challenge for both laboratory experiments and computational methods. To address this challenge, we developed a novel classification framework by re-purposing AlphaFold2 to generate conformational ensembles via a multiple sequence alignment sampling method. From these ensembles, we extract a comprehensive set of features characterizing the conformational ensemble's modality and structural dispersion. A random forest classifier trained on a carefully curated benchmark dataset of known metamorphic and single-fold proteins achieves a mean AUC of 0.869 with cross-validation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our integrated approach. Furthermore, by applying our classifier to 600 randomly sampled proteins from the Protein Data Bank, we identified several potential metamorphic protein candidates -- including the 40S ribosomal protein S30, whose conformational change is crucial for its secondary function in antimicrobial defense. By combining AI-driven protein structure prediction with statistical learning, our work provides a powerful new approach for discovering metamorphic proteins and deepens our understanding of their role in their molecular function.

### [Unlocking the application potential of AlphaFold3-like approaches in virtual screening.](https://doi.org/10.1039/d5sc06481c)
AlphaFold3 (AF3) has revolutionized the paradigm for protein-ligand complex structure prediction, yet its potential for structure-based virtual screening (VS) remains largely underexplored. Herein, we present a systematic assessment of AF3-like approaches for VS applications, using AF3, Protenix and Boltz-2 as representative models. Initial benchmarks on the well-established DEKOIS2.0 datasets demonstrate AF3's exceptional screening capability, driven solely by its intrinsic confidence metrics for compound ranking. While third-party scoring schemes do not improve efficacy, both AF3 and Protenix prove robust as pose generators. Further analysis reveals performance declines in three more challenging cases: progressive exclusion of chemically similar active ligands from test sets, evaluation on a novel GPCR dataset with limited structural representation in model training, and assessment on a subset of LIT-PCBA dataset whose inactive compounds were experimentally verified. Despite these limitations, these models consistently surpass conventional docking tools in accuracy in most cases. Pose analysis further indicates that most predictions adopt physically plausible conformations, albeit with minor structural artifacts. This study highlights the promise and current constraints of AF3-like methods in VS, offering practical insights for their deployment in modern drug discovery.

### [A Putative Interaction between the Transmembrane Domains of &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pyogenes&lt;/i&gt; Sortase A and Its Endogenous Substrate M Protein Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations.](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.5c05800)
Sortase enzymes are cysteine transpeptidases at the cell surface of Gram-positive bacteria. Localized to distinct foci on the cell membrane, class A sortases (SrtAs) recognize a cell wall sorting signal (CWSS), and, following cleavage at this specific binding motif, target proteins are ligated to precursors of the growing peptidoglycan layer. This activity of SrtA enzymes is utilized extensively in sortase-mediated ligation (SML) strategies for a variety of protein engineering applications. Typically, engineered variants of SrtA are used for SML experiments, considering the relatively low catalytic efficiency of this enzyme. Understandably, most biochemical studies are conducted with the isolated catalytic domain of SrtA enzymes from various bacteria, and the stereochemistry of the endogenous interaction between SrtA and its substrate is not well understood. Here, we used AlphaFold2 to create a model of the full-length SrtA enzyme from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> (spySrtA) with or without either a peptide substrate or a portion of M protein, a cellular target. We ran triplicate 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations for each model embedded in a lipid bilayer, which revealed several stereochemical features of this system. Contact map analyses revealed specific interactions between catalytic domain positions of spySrtA and the lipid bilayer, as well as between the enzyme and M protein residues outside the canonical LPXTG pentapeptide CWSS. We also characterized a putative transmembrane domain interaction between spySrtA and M protein that we predict orients and stabilizes substrate binding. If present <i>in vivo</i>, we predict that these interactions may increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for its substrates and could provide important stereochemical insights for SML uses.
